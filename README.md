# Diabetes-Prediction-Model Introduction and Goal
In this project, I train an ML model on a dataset containing information about various patients. I explore the correlation between each of the different features and the outcome of whether or not a patient has diabetes, as well as significant statistics for each of the features (i.e. mean, median, std, etc).

# Dataset
Dataset sourced from Kaggle
This dataset contains information about patients, specifically:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose levels
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin levels
- BMI
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age
- Whether or not they have diabetes

# Training the Model
Using a Linear Regression, I train the model based on BMI and Insulin levels in order to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.
